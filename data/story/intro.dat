This is placeholder text.
I am going to worry about the story later on.
For now, read my rant about this game development.

Why is windows development so dumb and complicated,
all the while development on linux is not.
Each time that the game works while development on linux,
but decides to not work when building in Windows,
it is not a pleasant experience.
As I then need to search how to fix this Windows compiler issue,
because of how quirky it is.
Perhaps I still have yet to resolve for other compilers,
like MingGW or Clang or something.
Since Visual Studio uses MSVC or something.
But since I don't use MingGW or Clang or stuff,
then that is not my issue.

Anyways,
I don't know how long the intro story will be.
So let's pretend that it goes on longer than this text.
But for now, I'll let you play the game now.
Also, all the possible actions will be printed before this is.
So new players can know what to type.
I bid my adieu.......
